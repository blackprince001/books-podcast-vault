How to focus to Change your Brain | Huberman Neuroscience Series
(Neuroplasticity)  #Neuroscience, #Podcast

```
This episode introduces neuroplasticityâ€”which is how our brain and nervous system learn and acquire new capabilities. He describes the differences between childhood and adult neuroplasticity, the chemicals involved and how anyone can increase their rate and depth of learning by leveraging the science of focus. He describes specific tools for increasing focus and learning. The next two episodes will cover the ideal protocols for specific types of learning and how to make learning new information more reflexive.

# Tips from the Podcast :

- What is Neuroplasticity 
- What forms are there?
- How to utilize Neuroplasticity to reform Focus at any stage in life. 

Our Brains and Neural System is optimized for learning. We learn and Unlearn as we grow, which results in the removal of some neural connections ( Neuroplasticity).

After puberty, the human brain adds very few neurons. Neurogenesis is reduced in the brain and this causes less and less neuroplasticity, and thus learning reduces. This is partly why it is relatively hard to learn new things as you grow older. But this is not tied to all the neurons in the body.

This is not all bad as it could have better implications in moments of grief; removal of connections could be vital for recovery. This is inferred from the thought that if you have deepened neural pathway that results in heavy sympathy towards bereaved people, it could greatly increase your period of recovery from grievous events that happen to you as well. Neuroplasticity gives off some sort of new perspectives for your way of thinking or approach.

Using Sensory Apparati (deficits and impairment), we can invoke neuroplasticity at any stage in life. Loss in sensory activity in one part of the brain could induce better functionality in other parts. A loss of sight correlates to high hearing abilities in blind people, or any loss of sensory functionality could result in a heightened ability in another. An example well classified to Beethoven, the famous composer. His deafness at the time of his virtuous musical compositions shows very well how this is true, amongst the numerous other people with similar experiences.

# Neuroplasticity Harness:

- *Awareness Cues Brain Change*; the first order of custom neuroplasticity is recognizing the need for change, awareness of an issue to be solved, or the desire to learn something new.

- Experiences don't change the brain, it's the neurochemicals and other chemicals released at the time of the experience that does the magic (creating the right atmosphere). Events can be very lively and life-changing depending on the mood set of the body: that's why some don't feel as ecstatic as we hoped in events of expected excitement. 

tip: Moreover, the experiences you pay more attention to are likely to induce neuroplasticity.

- Adrenaline & Alertness. Epinephrine is released when we are paying attention and when we are alert. When we create cones of attention in midst of high levels of sensory input from every corner of the surroundings, it implies there has been a release of Acetylcholine into the Thalamus. Direct focus on subjects of interest of attention is influenced by how much Acetylcholine is released, serving as a spotlight for our subject of focus. 

tip: Induce a lot of Epinephrine, Cortisol and other chemicals with Caffeine and a proper sleep schedule, for better focus levels.

tip: Positive Reinforcement isn't always a good thing. Getting hyped up by comments and remarks will do you a world of good feelings but when the dip comes around, you lose motivation to achieve whatever there was or left to be completed

# How to Increase Focus:

- Visual Focus with Mental Focus. Conscious mental efforts to focus on a subject also direct the visual focus system to align. Repetition of this activity more often than not channels Neuroplasticity in your brain. More like the bullet on creating the right atmosphere, you get to create that atmosphere that makes you succeed  (Atomic Habits) and your brain will relive that process all the time.

	- Blinking less reduces the action of laziness. In moments of sleepiness, catch a small nap and wake up instantly with high levels of alertness for focus. (An activity supposed to be done by Galileo and a few other prominent scientists)

	- Auditory approaches. An ear towards learning also improves learning. The more you can listen without distractive visual inputs, the better the retention of information learnt. Podcasts are great when you are sourcing information.

- Indulging Caffeinated drinks to increase Epinephrine while also preserving sleep schedules and circadian rhythms.

- Bouts of learning capped at 90mins with 30mins extra for review and summaries. Neuroplasticity as learnt will occur during sleep and things learnt during the day or whatever time alertness or attentive focus learning was done, will be cemented in the brain as new connections.

- Mind Drifts accelerate learning. Mind wandering after an episode of focus learning can be used to accelerate learning, essentially adding mind-wandering activities into summary sessions (devoid of distractions). * Mind wandering - a topic about why Boredom is good for us*
