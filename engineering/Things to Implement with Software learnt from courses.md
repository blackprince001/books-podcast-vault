* A memory interfacer
* amplifier circuits with simulated values
* an emulator for RISC instruction set or a group selected instruction sets
	* expand on this and research how to make a custom chip to a particular task efficiently with minimal instruction sets
* a graph-baser appRouter that makes use of routes as nodes

to be continued.
